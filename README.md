<h2 align="center"><strong>What is the Minitalk?</strong></h2>

Minitalk is about send messages to a server using signals. The server will receive the message and print it. The server will also send a signal to the client to confirm that the message was received.

<h2 align=><strong>How to use?</strong></h2>

1. Clone the repository:
2. Run the command `make` to compile the server and the client.
3. Open two terminals.
4. In the first terminal, run the command `./server`.
5. In the second terminal, run the command `./client <PID> <message>`, where `<PID>` is the process ID of the server and `<message>` is the message you want to send.
